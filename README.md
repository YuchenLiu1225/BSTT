 We evaluate our model on the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS)-SS3 dataset and ISRUC dataset. The Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) is an open-access and collaborative database of laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) recordings. Information on how to obtain MASS-SS3 can be found [here](http://massdb.herokuapp.com/en/). Information on how to obtain ISRUC can be found [here](https://sleeptight.isr.uc.pt/).
